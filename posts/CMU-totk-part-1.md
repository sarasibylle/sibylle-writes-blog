#### I have never finished a Zelda game.

Growing up, my long journeys as a child were interspersed with Mario and Pokémon on the original Nintendo Gameboy. They were my home away from home, a distraction from a miserable reality.

Even with linear games, I’ve always been a cautiously chaotic gamer. I break overworld tutorials on first plays. Save scum repeatedly until the game crashes. But with Ocarina of Time? The water temple was my limit for a twelve-year old me. 

Since then, I lost interest in playing Zelda, and spent years watching others’ Let’s Play, speedruns, and getting too emotional over hours of campaign stories.

Finally, I had enough avoiding it. I decided it was my time to re-initiate myself to earn my title as a Zelda fan. So, in the summer of 2023, off I began my adventure as a really old, yet forever young Link hiking around Hyrule, destined to fight Ganondorf and save Zelda. Only this time, as a newbie to Zelda gameplay.

In this series, **Part 1** is a case study on the game’s user interface (UI). It has light story spoilers and a few early boss reveals. Most of the screen captures will show late-game stats where I have all Sages, most hearts and full stamina, avoiding major quest or plot reveals.

**Part 2** is a reflection of how this game has affected me and the joy and frustration I’ve gained from it. It discusses the entire game and is spoiler-filled.

##### A. The Fall

The game starts with Link following his beloved Zelda down Hyrule Castle’s steps as she eagerly seeks to unravel the mysterious miasma floating around our feet. Descending ever deeper down the creepy castle tunnels, I have no controls available except to walk and listen.

I don’t like horror games. The most I’d play is one that’s more drama than horror. Think Witcher or Alan Wake. Descending down a dark cramped castle, with the most basic of controls and my character’s love of his life in front of her gave me the creeps. As loyal Link I pursue on, anxiously watching Zelda’s back while we proceed towards Hyrule’s long-lost history.

Like the thickening gloom, I find the progressive unravelling of player controls very effective in conveying the vast adventure that Tears of the Kingdom has waiting for me to discover.
Thankfully, I get the brief chance to mash ‘X’ briefly to fight off Keese with my faithful Master Sword (and without any of Zelda’s help!).

We proceed deeper into the heart of Hyrule’s 'best-kept secret,’ and it isn’t long that we find ourselves in a cavernous hall filled with mysterious Zonai carvings. While an excited Zelda attempts to decrypt an ancient carving about The Imprisoning War, she is quick to tell me to snap a couple pics to satiate her interest, and Link obediently follows. I quickly learn how to use the Camera function on my Purah Pad/Sheikah Slate.
We ascend deeper into the darkness after, and the sense of ominous discovery continues.

In the heart of the gloom, we find a certain saviour’s arm sealing a familiar figure - no points for guessing who it is. It culminates into a direct confrontation with the Calamity himself, where I am rendered powerless no matter how much I smash the _‘X’_ button to save my princess.

Link wakes up in a cave, one steeped in a thousand years of deja vu. On top of tragically losing Zelda, Link has lost all his armour and weapons. The game pulls no punches – I notice my 30 hearts whittled to 3 instantly and my beloved Master Sword lodged in a rock, cut down to her hilt.

Examining her shows me the first essential key – _‘A’_. When I pick it up, an item dialog appears with a mysterious chime, telling me that the “Decayed Master Sword” has an attack of 1 because of its diminished power. Nifty. Furthermore, tapping ‘+’ opens my inventory to remind me how I was stripped of everything. Thanks Ganon!

Next, the long-awaited Attack key of _‘Y’_ unlocks for me to slash through some vines to start my quest to save Zelda.

Mercifully, getting out of the cave is an easy route of climbing ledges and solving basic puzzles. I quickly learn A as an **essential button to Examine, Unlock, and Jump** while I navigate the cave. Also that the (lack of) stamina memes are true. We’ll get to that later.

By lining up cave pools in succession, the game cleverly teaches me that jumping headfirst into water breaks my fall. I tap ‘A’ again to get a pair of archaic hand-me-downs reminiscent of a certain Zonai.

At last, I emerge into the beautiful daylight of the Great Sky Island, a map I revisit many times over the span of 300 hours.

In a swell of orchestral music, a soaring piece plays as Link leaps from the island down into a new Hyrule.

**What an introduction. The game has officially started.**

##### B.  Out in the Wild, again.

First things first – with the green in my stamina shrinking, I have to get to shore before I drown. Yes, an overly curious me has drowned in that tiny pool in the introduction.

There is no fanfare to landing on the Great Sky Island proper. Its name appears in the title display while my eager Link runs down stone steps and into a _‘???’_ labelled item. A familiar jingle plays when I pick up the tree branch and am told how to cycle through weapons. I’m raring to whack a couple Constructs while feasting on apples for a half-heart each. Also, I learn how to dodge by accident. Neat.

Without any inventory or additional skills, the basic UI is pleasantly minimalist with the mini-map, temperature and an audio meter on the right. Looking at this in hindsight, I prefer its simplicity before it gets cluttered from each level up.
