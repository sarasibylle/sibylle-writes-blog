#### I have never finished a Zelda game.

Growing up, my long journeys as a child were interspersed with Mario and Pokémon on the original Nintendo Gameboy. They were my home away from home, a distraction from a miserable reality.

Even with linear games, I’ve always been a cautiously chaotic gamer. I break overworld tutorials on first plays. Save scum repeatedly until the game crashes. But with Ocarina of Time? The water temple was my limit for a twelve-year old me. 

Since then, I lost interest in playing Zelda, and spent years watching others’ Let’s Play, speedruns, and getting too emotional over hours of campaign stories.

Finally, I had enough avoiding it. I decided it was my time to re-initiate myself to earn my title as a Zelda fan. So, in the summer of 2023, off I began my adventure as a really old, yet forever young Link hiking around Hyrule, destined to fight Ganondorf and save Zelda. Only this time, as a newbie to Zelda gameplay.

In this series, **Part 1** is a case study on the game’s user interface (UI). It has light story spoilers and a few early boss reveals. Most of the screen captures will show late-game stats where I have all Sages, most hearts and full stamina, avoiding major quest or plot reveals.

**Part 2** is a reflection of how this game has affected me and the joy and frustration I’ve gained from it. It discusses the entire game and is spoiler-filled.

#### A. The Fall

The game starts with Link following his beloved Zelda down Hyrule Castle’s steps as she eagerly seeks to unravel the mysterious miasma floating around our feet. Descending ever deeper down the creepy castle tunnels, I have no controls available except to walk and listen.

I don’t like horror games. The most I’d play is one that’s more drama than horror. Think Witcher or Alan Wake. Descending down a dark cramped castle, with the most basic of controls and my character’s love of his life in front of her gave me the creeps. As loyal Link I pursue on, anxiously watching Zelda’s back while we proceed towards Hyrule’s long-lost history.

Like the thickening gloom, I find the progressive unravelling of player controls very effective in conveying the vast adventure that Tears of the Kingdom has waiting for me to discover.
Thankfully, I get the brief chance to mash ‘X’ briefly to fight off Keese with my faithful Master Sword (and without any of Zelda’s help!).

We proceed deeper into the heart of Hyrule’s 'best-kept secret,’ and it isn’t long that we find ourselves in a cavernous hall filled with mysterious Zonai carvings. While an excited Zelda attempts to decrypt an ancient carving about The Imprisoning War, she is quick to tell me to snap a couple pics to satiate her interest, and Link obediently follows. I quickly learn how to use the Camera function on my Purah Pad/Sheikah Slate.
We ascend deeper into the darkness after, and the sense of ominous discovery continues.

In the heart of the gloom, we find a certain saviour’s arm sealing a familiar figure - no points for guessing who it is. It culminates into a direct confrontation with the Calamity himself, where I am rendered powerless no matter how much I smash the _‘X’_ button to save my princess.

Link wakes up in a cave, one steeped in a thousand years of deja vu. On top of tragically losing Zelda, Link has lost all his armour and weapons. The game pulls no punches – I notice my 30 hearts whittled to 3 instantly and my beloved Master Sword lodged in a rock, cut down to her hilt.

Examining her shows me the first essential key – _‘A’_. When I pick it up, an item dialog appears with a mysterious chime, telling me that the “Decayed Master Sword” has an attack of 1 because of its diminished power. Nifty. Furthermore, tapping ‘+’ opens my inventory to remind me how I was stripped of everything. Thanks Ganon!

Next, the long-awaited Attack key of _‘Y’_ unlocks for me to slash through some vines to start my quest to save Zelda.

Mercifully, getting out of the cave is an easy route of climbing ledges and solving basic puzzles. I quickly learn A as an **essential button to Examine, Unlock, and Jump** while I navigate the cave. Also that the (lack of) stamina memes are true. We’ll get to that later.

By lining up cave pools in succession, the game cleverly teaches me that jumping headfirst into water breaks my fall. I tap ‘A’ again to get a pair of archaic hand-me-downs reminiscent of a certain Zonai.

At last, I emerge into the beautiful daylight of the Great Sky Island, a map I revisit many times over the span of 300 hours.

In a swell of orchestral music, a soaring piece plays as Link leaps from the island down into a new Hyrule.

**What an introduction. The game has officially started.**

#### B.  Out in the Wild, again.

First things first – with the green in my stamina shrinking, I have to get to shore before I drown. Yes, an overly curious me has drowned in that tiny pool in the introduction.

There is no fanfare to landing on the Great Sky Island proper. Its name appears in the title display while my eager Link runs down stone steps and into a _‘???’_ labelled item. A familiar jingle plays when I pick up the tree branch and am told how to cycle through weapons. I’m raring to whack a couple Constructs while feasting on apples for a half-heart each. Also, I learn how to dodge by accident. Neat.


![Screenshot of the starter UI.](/static/img/totk/starter-island1.jpg)

Without any inventory or additional skills, the basic UI is pleasantly minimalist with the mini-map, temperature and an audio meter on the right. Looking at this in hindsight, I prefer its simplicity before it gets cluttered from each level up.

<mark>Above</mark>: Earning a Sage skill fills a permanent space above the directional buttons. Obtaining a shield adds a third left icon to these buttons.

As I progress through Great ~~Starter~~ Sky Island, the progressive disclosure of finding Shrines and unlocking skills eases me into the main mechanics of an open-world Zelda game. While much of it is rinse and repeat for Breath of the Wild players, it’s a breath of fresh air for N64 me.

Let’s talk about Ultrahand. The brainchild of Fujibayashi Hidemaro, Nintendo’s director, he further developed Breath of the Wild’s engine to create the Ultrahand mechanic. His intention was to keep things  “simple enough that anybody can pick it up and play without too much of an issue” and provide “more versatility and freedom.” <i>Quote from Game Maker's Toolkit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvOqTunOQB8">video essay on Ultrahand</a></i>.

Ultrahand is _indispensable_ to this game. On this island alone, it becomes a great way to break up the tedious task of fighting monsters and gathering food.

Re-uniting Koroks by glueing and un-glueing them to inanimate objects? Love.

Wiggling the stick and having Zonai devices topple randomly to the ground, then reassembling them however? It’s playful on the first few tries, but complex puzzles easily take a half hour for perfect alignment. A slow, definite dislike.

Nonetheless, Nintendo ingeniously shows the possibilities of this skill with Shrine puzzles, allowing me to learn the power of Ultra(glue)hand to obtain even more powerful skills and try out crazy ideas as I progress.

#### C: Same but Different

![Screenshot of Link completing the island.](/static/img/totk/starterisland5-leaving.jpg)

At last, Link obtains the precious fourth heart and Rewind (Recall) for the last portion of the tutorial. Having Fast Travel added to my map allows me to reach the final shrine and complete the island. Thanks Rauru! 
Before I can leave it, there’s one new button to learn: _Hold ‘A’._

Link braces his muscles while I brace my fingers, and we push against the doors and the screen’s edges pulse red as I watch each heart decrease in quarter increments. For someone first-introduced to Quick Time Events (QTEs) via Quantic Dream’s tragic dramas, the hold ‘A’ mechanic can either be an interesting change or plain annoying. Thankfully, holding ‘A’ to open the doors and be granted true freedom instils in me a sense of accomplishment.

The doors rumble open. Rauru imparts his final wisdom before I ascend to the edge of the Temple of Time. With the help of the Master Sword, the sword switches places in time, landing in Zelda’s hands.

Then, a beautiful cinematic parts the clouds to unveil Hyrule waiting for me below. Finally, I leap down.

<br>

I expected Hyrule would be different after what happened in Breath of the Wild. 

What I did not expect was to be immediately chased by Bokoblins, soaking wet from my skyfall! I run down a grass slope to the main path, hit immediately with the sight of Hyrule Castle floating in the air, enveloped by Gloom. Nearby, I find Hudson Building Supplies and immediately begin Ultrahand-ing wood and wheels to get to Lookout Landing ASAP.

Or at least, that’s what my map tells me will be easy.

Although Great Sky Island wet my feet in getting Link to have passable stick-fighting and korok-saving skills, being thrown into Hyrule as a Zelda novice turned out a lot more challenging.

-----

<br>

The first challenge was **weapon durability**. Yes, bokoblins are beginner monsters. Yes, sticks and stones are everywhere to glue together into basic weapons. No, I am bad at blocking and attacking at the same time. Missing more often at perfect dodge than I’d like, I kept breaking my basic weapons and would run and **ultrahand on the fly, or reuse monster drops** as quickly as possible.

The second challenge was building **more complicated devices with ultrahand.** A cart to get me to Lookout Landing seemed simple enough – until I spent 15 minutes trying to align all four wheels against the rectangle board’s edges perfectly.

Both challenges took me long enough to cause a blood moon. So, yes, after 148 minutes of doing dumb stuff, I gave up fighting respawned ‘blins and sped my push-cart as quickly as I could with 3 fans and no steering.

At last I reach the tower and meet (a younger?) Purah. She tells me to fill out the rest of Hyrule’s map and teaches me that getting shot into the clouds is a perfectly good way to scan my surrounding area. Neat.

By now, the game assumes that I’m familiar with its basic gameplay mechanics, prompting me to advance them by obtaining Sage skills, mastering Fuse, and landing attack-dodge combos.

On one (ultra)hand, this linear, yet rapid progression into such a vast game can be unforgiving to new RPG players. On the other, being left to my (zonai) devices as a seasoned RPG player to experiment with various gameplay styles and brush up on my melee skills by getting destroyed by higher-level enemies is priceless.

#### D: Visuals and Environment

Enough puns. Let’s switch gears and discuss the visual interface.

Historically, Zelda games have always been steeped in a fantastical and breathtakingly magical environment. Sharing the same lineage of jRPG action-adventures as Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, these games are meant to immerse their players in their realms, down to how each character is introduced.

This dedication to fantasy applies to even the smallest things, which I’ll first discuss.

From my very first meeting with Zelda, the most-important supporting characters have title introductions that match their grand cutscenes. Following convention, each character has a brief description matching their current state as Link knows them.
Befitting of her royalty, Zelda gets “Princess of Hyrule,” while mysterious Rauru gets a plaintive “Source of the Right Arm.”  Likewise, our beloved Sidon gets a new description as “Prince of the Zora” as he leaps out of the water to hug Link. They also gain a new entry in Link’s journal/database accompanied with watercolour art.

Furthermore, these descriptions develop with plot progression.
