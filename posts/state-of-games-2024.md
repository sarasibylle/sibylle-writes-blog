The games industry I know now is very different from what I knew before. As someone who wanted to break into it years ago but ended up on a surreal path towards traditional print design, then digital UX design, I've always had to look in as an outsider.

As this is my attempt at finally breaking into games, I must first address how **dire** it's become.

Even a cursory look at [Video Game Layoffs](https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024) up until March this year shows an astounding **8000 layoffs** across multiple studios of all levels and locations. Game adjacent properties too have not been spared. Rooster Teeth has shut down and GameSpot carried out another round of layoffs, just to name a few. Not every studio can be as bulletproof as Larian or Remedy Entertainment, the latter [gaining back the IP](https://gamerant.com/remedy-owns-control-ip-franchise/) for Control after a long contested parting with 505 Games.

When we thought 2023 couldn’t get any worse, 2024 continues the bloodbath akin to a Game of Thrones Red Wedding.

GameSpot broached the topic with a fantastic, detailed read on [why layoffs have been worsening](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/) since the pandemic, with little signs of slowing down.

A combination of lack of value investments, decreasing stock prices, inflation, pandemic-caused overstaffing, GenAI concerns, and choosing the appearance of growth over a sustainable business model are discussed as key factors keeping the noose over the game industry’s neck.

Whether you were laid off the week before Christmas or trying to preserve your sanity between two jobs and kids, all this affects ‘normies’ like us – those who want their love of games to put food on the table. The trickle-down effect is especially devastating because games _is_ an investment. Getting good at games is comparable to any trade that has upfront costs. Gaining experience to enter the game industry comes from playing and building games, investments that are out-of-pocket. On top of this, the stiff competition from other job-seekers around the world makes the job application process a soul-defeating task. Coming from the UX design industry where similar things are happening, I’m all too familiar with the struggle.

Game quality and interest has never been higher, yet the industry is still playing catch up.

So where _does_ that leave us? The job-seekers and the career-switchers? Is there a ray of hope underneath the giant storm cloud? Can we hope for any equity in such a challenging landscape?

I don’t know, but here are a few positive stats.

For one, the game community has always been here. Whether I’m in the US, India, or Sweden, community support has always been a bedrock for those seeking and those offering experience. Thousands of layoffs means thousands of like-minded people in the same boat.

Although proper representation of LGBTQ+ characters has progressed [at a snail’s pace](https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/02/16/lgbtq-gamers-glaad-media-report/), Gaymers have often found allies within the game community. Even if they aren’t as visible on bigger social and streaming platforms such as Youtube and Twitch, LGBTQ gamers have always fought for their right to exist, let alone be represented in gaming. No longer [a ‘happy accident’](https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/19/5825904/the-sims-same-sex-relationships) like the Sims, the community has led the narrative with [staging walkouts](https://www.xperthr.com/news/activision-employees-stage-walkout-for-lgbtq-reproductive-rights-protection/50867/) to [hosting events](https://gaymerx.org/), proudly sharing our pronouns to support others who aren’t able to.

The layoffs have further contributed to a jump in new studios spearheaded by those laid off. In the UK, it’s [gone up by 22%](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-gaming-start-ups-have-increased-by-22-in-2023), and notable alumni have formed studios such as [Blank](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cd-projekt-red-alumni-create-new-studio-blank), [Giant Skull](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-star-wars-jedi-director-unveils-new-single-player-game-studio-giant-skull) and [Shapeshifter](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/volition-alumni-on-building-shapeshifter-games-in-an-era-of-layoffs-and-closures).

Those that are laid off are banding with each other and forming their own communities to put a dent in monolithic studios holding all the cards. Frankly, these smaller studios navigate their cultural settings more expertly than the monoliths; successfully [raising funds on their own](https://www.techinasia.com/ai-powered-gaming-startup-raises-5-25m-in-seed-funding), and winning awards for [unique narratives](https://gdconf.com/news/venba-wins-grand-prize-2024-independent-games-festival-awards).

Are these signs of a David versus Goliath success story coming up for the games industry?

That would mean the AAA studios recognizing the efforts and sacrifices their employees make to ship a quality game on time. That would mean players willing to call out studios that treat their employees as tools and not people. That would mean committing to sustainable, healthy hiring and ethical practices. 

It’s a lot to ask for in an industry where both its biggest headliners down to its streamers disrespect both creators and players.

Regardless, like many others, I hold on to hope. Giving back to the community and calling out discrimination adds to the chorus of a more sustainable industry. What’s my biggest hope? To not have to write a similar post come 2025.
