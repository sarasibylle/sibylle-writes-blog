The games industry I know now is very different from what I knew before. As someone who wanted to break into it 20 years ago but ended up on a surreal path towards traditional print design, then digital UX design, I've always had to look in, as an outsider.

As this is my attempt at finally breaking into games, I must address how *bad* it's become.
